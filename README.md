I am a Physicist by formal training.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Machine Learning by following the course Machine Learning by Andrew Ng on Coursera
    and reading Elements of Statistical Learning by Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Data Science projects, DeFi projects, or the intersection thereof
